 * Leaderboard generations.
 *
 * There is one results file per leaderboard, and it accumulates. The benchmark itself
 * changes over time — categories get added, tests get fixed — so a score from one round
 * is not comparable to a score from another. Rather than overwrite, each result row
 * carries the generation it was produced in, and the site groups and ranks by that.
 *
 * So a generation is a label on rows, not a file. `evals/collect.js` stamps it when
 * folding a run into a leaderboard, which is what lets one file hold several rounds
 * and still present them honestly.
 *
 * Ordered oldest first; the last one with rows present is treated as current.
