/**
 * Simulation Completion Evaluation
 *
 * This evaluation category tests whether the stock-and-flow models an engine builds are
 * actually runnable: it takes the generated SD-JSON model, converts it to XMILE, and runs
 * it through the PySD simulator, confirming that the model simulates all the way to the end
 * of its own time horizon.
 *
 * Where the quantitative-reasoning and translation categories check whether a model contains
 * the right structure, this category checks the far more basic property that the structure
 * the engine produced can be numerically integrated at all. A model that references a
 * variable it never defines, divides by zero, leaves a flow without an equation, or omits a
 * usable set of simulation specs will build fine as JSON but will fail the moment a simulator
 * tries to run it. This test catches exactly those failures.
 *
 * For each scenario the engine is asked to build a complete, simulatable quantitative
 * stock-and-flow model. The evaluation then verifies, in order:
 *
 *   1. Structure — the model contains at least one stock and one flow (i.e. it really is a
 *      stock-and-flow model) and defines numeric simulation specs with a stopTime that is
 *      strictly later than its startTime, so "the end" of the run is well defined.
 *   2. Convertibility — the model can be converted to XMILE without error.
 *   3. Simulatability — PySD loads and runs the model without raising an error while tracking
 *      every stock (the integrated state variables) in the model.
 *   4. Completion — the returned time series reaches the model's stopTime (the run was not cut
 *      short), and every stock trajectory is made up of finite values from start to finish,
 *      so the model did not blow up numerically before reaching the end.

Shipments equal customer demand, which is a constant 100 units per week. The store wants to keep inventory at a desired level equal to a target coverage of expected sales: desired inventory equals demand multiplied by a desired coverage of 4 weeks. The production rate equals demand plus a correction that closes the gap between desired inventory and current inventory over an inventory adjustment time of 8 weeks (that is, production equals demand plus (desired inventory minus inventory) divided by the adjustment time).

Use a prey birth rate coefficient of 0.5, a predation coefficient of 0.02, a predator efficiency coefficient of 0.01, and a predator death rate coefficient of 0.4 (all per appropriate time unit).

Undiscovered rework is not visible immediately: it is detected and flows back into work to be done at a rework discovery rate equal to the undiscovered rework stock divided by an average discovery delay. Use an initial work to be done of 500 tasks, an initial undiscovered rework of 0 tasks, and an initial work truly done of 0 tasks. Use 10 developers, a productivity of 0.4 tasks per developer per week, a fraction correct of 0.85 (so 0.15 of completed work becomes undiscovered rework), and an average discovery delay of 4 weeks.
