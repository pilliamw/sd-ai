Each test hands the engine an existing stock-and-flow model as the current model, plus a written description of the stocks and flows to add, and grades both halves of that job — whether the new structure arrived, and whether the old structure survived intact.`,
        `As in quantitative translation, the tests are set in a gibberish universe so nothing can be answered from world knowledge, and the English and the ground truth are generated from one specification. Added stocks come with initial values and flows that are either fixed amounts per time unit or proportional rates, and a proportional flow may draw on a stock that is already in the model handed over — which is how the new structure is made to connect to the old rather than sit beside it. Variables that already exist are named in the prose exactly as the model names them, not pluralized, so the description points at the right variable.`,
        `The five groups scale the addition from a single stock to five, including self-contained systems, branching structures and mixed flow types.`,
        `Grading compares the returned stocks against two references at once: the stocks the description asked for, and the stocks of the model that was handed over. Names are matched with pluralization-tolerant matching in either direction. A stock belonging to the model handed over is never counted as a fabrication — only stocks present in neither reference are — so preserving prior structure is rewarded rather than punished.`,
        `Each pre-existing stock is then checked for damage: it must still be there, its initial value must be unchanged (directly or through a variable its equation references), and it must retain at least as many inflows and outflows as it had. "At least" is deliberate — the description may attach new flows to an existing stock, so the check is that nothing was removed.`,
        `Each requested stock is checked as in quantitative translation: initial value equal to the ground truth, an exact match on the number of inflows and outflows, and every flow in the specification found among the flows that stock names, matched on arithmetic — a proportional flow multiplying and carrying the rate, or drawing on a cause variable whose equation is the rate; a fixed flow equal to the constant or referencing a variable holding it.
