/**
 * This is the variable documentation test
 *
 * The variable documentation evaluation category tests whether engines produce complete,
 * high-quality documentation for every variable in the models they build. Where the
 * feedback explanation test checks the text of a discussion engine for known facts, this
 * test inspects the structure of a generated model. It measures two things:
 *
 *   1. Coverage — every variable in the returned model must carry a non-empty
 *      `documentation` string (see the SD-JSON `variables[].documentation` field in the
 *      top-level project README).
 *   2. Quality — in a single structured-output pass, an LLM judge verifies that each
 *      variable's documentation is accurate, specific, and genuinely descriptive of that
 *      variable's role within the system, rather than a vacuous restatement of the
 *      variable's name. The judge returns a `success`/`failureReason` verdict per variable.

        problemStatement: "I want to understand how a store's inventory of a product fluctuates as it is restocked and sold.",
        backgroundKnowledge: `A store holds an inventory of a product. Inventory rises as new units are produced or delivered and falls as units are sold to customers. The store tries to keep inventory near a desired coverage of expected sales, ordering more when inventory is low. Sales depend on customer demand, which can be limited by how much inventory is available.`

        problemStatement: "I want to understand how an infectious disease spreads through a population over the course of an outbreak.",
        backgroundKnowledge: `In a classic epidemic model a population is divided into people who are susceptible, people who are currently infected, and people who have recovered. Susceptible people become infected through contact with infected people, at a rate that depends on the contact rate and the infectivity of the disease. Infected people recover after an average duration of illness, moving into the recovered group.`
    },
    "Software Project Rework": {
        problemStatement: "I want to understand why software projects run late even when the team works hard, and how undiscovered errors and schedule pressure feed on each other over the life of a project.",
        backgroundKnowledge: `A software project has a fixed scope of work. Tasks begin in a backlog of work still to be done and move to a pool of completed work as the team finishes them at a work rate. The work rate depends on the number of developers and their productivity. Not all completed work is actually correct: a fraction contains defects and becomes undiscovered rework instead of being truly finished. Undiscovered rework is not visible to the team until it is found during testing, after a discovery delay, at which point it flows back into the backlog of work to be done. As the deadline approaches with work remaining, schedule pressure rises. Higher schedule pressure pushes developers to work faster, raising the work rate, but it also raises the fraction of work done incorrectly (haste makes waste), which generates still more undiscovered rework and further delays the project. Sustained overtime also erodes productivity as developers fatigue.`
    },
    "Fishery Boom and Bust": {
        problemStatement: "I want to understand how a commercial fishery can collapse from overharvesting, and why fishing fleet investment tends to drive boom-and-bust cycles in the fish population.",
        backgroundKnowledge: `A fish population grows through births and shrinks through natural deaths and through harvesting by a fishing fleet. The population regenerates fastest at intermediate levels and its net regeneration falls toward zero as it approaches the carrying capacity of the habitat or is driven near depletion. The harvest rate rises with both the number of fishing ships and the density of fish, since the catch per ship is higher when fish are abundant. Revenue from the harvest, less the operating cost of running the ships, determines the profit per ship. Profit drives investment in new ships, though new capacity is added only after a construction and financing delay; when profit turns negative, ships are scrapped or leave the fishery. More ships raise the harvest, which depletes the fish population, which lowers the catch per ship and eventually profit — a balancing process — but the investment delays cause the fleet to overshoot the sustainable level, producing cycles of boom and collapse.`
    },
    "Market Growth and Capacity": {
        problemStatement: "I want to understand why a fast-growing company's sales can stall or oscillate as it struggles to expand production capacity quickly enough to meet demand.",
        backgroundKnowledge: `A company's installed base of customers grows as the sales force wins new customers and shrinks as existing customers are lost. Customers place orders, and orders that cannot be filled immediately accumulate in a backlog. Production capacity limits how quickly the backlog can be filled, so the delivery delay experienced by customers is the backlog divided by the available capacity. A longer delivery delay reduces the company's attractiveness, which lowers the order rate and slows customer acquisition — a balancing loop that constrains growth. Revenue from filled orders funds investment in both the sales force and additional production capacity, but new capacity comes online only after a construction delay. A larger sales force wins customers faster, creating a reinforcing growth loop, while the capacity and delivery-delay dynamics push back against that growth and can cause sales to overshoot and oscillate.`
