/**
 * This is the policy guidance test
 *
 * The policy guidance evaluation category tests whether a model discussion engine can act as a
 * good tutor to a novice modeler: given a *complete* example model that currently behaves in an
 * undesirable way, can the engine generate the questions and discussion that bring the novice to
 * a greater understanding of the policies that could steer the system toward desirable behavior?
 *
 * This directly targets the ability to teach leverage: it is not enough to name a fix, the
 * engine must help the learner see *why* a policy works by connecting it to the model's feedback
 * structure, and it must engage the learner with guiding questions rather than simply lecturing.
 *
 * Unlike the model-building categories, every test here feeds the engine a full, pre-built
 * example model as input (the classic textbook models reused from the feedback explanation data:
 * an arms race, Bass diffusion, an inventory–workforce system, and Forrester's market growth
 * model). Each model exhibits a well-known problem behavior (escalation, a slow adoption takeoff,
 * oscillation, or growth that stalls), and each has a well-established policy story about the
 * leverage points that would produce more desirable behavior.
 *
 * For each test the engine is asked, in the voice of a novice, to discuss what policies could
 * move the system toward a stated desirable behavior and to teach through guiding questions. A
 * single structured-output LLM judge then assesses, in one pass, (1) whether the discussion
 * engages each of the key policy insights experts consider essential for that model — counting
 * an insight as covered whether it is stated directly or reached through a guiding question, so
 * the rubric does not penalize genuine Socratic teaching — and (2) whether the discussion
 * actually generates guiding questions that engage the novice. A test fails if any key policy
 * insight is missing or if the engine does not pose guiding questions.

        keyPolicies: [
            "Adoption is driven by a reinforcing word-of-mouth loop in which more adopters create more contacts that convert potential adopters, so the leverage is in the strength of that loop — raising the contact rate or the adoption fraction (for example through referral incentives or making the product more shareable) speeds the takeoff.",
            "Because word-of-mouth adoption is proportional to the number of existing adopters, the takeoff depends on an initial base of adopters; a policy that seeds early adopters (such as advertising or free trials, which this word-of-mouth-only model does not yet represent) jump-starts the reinforcing loop and pulls the S-curve earlier.",

            "The company's goal for acceptable delivery delay is a key leverage parameter, because it sets the pressure to expand capacity: a loose (long) delivery-delay goal tolerates poor service and suppresses capacity investment, letting growth stall, whereas holding a tight goal keeps expansion pressure high and drives timely capacity expansion.",

Assess two things:
1. Policy insight coverage — for each numbered key policy insight, decide whether the discussion brings that idea to the learner. The discussion need not use the same wording or variable names; it is enough that the specific concept is engaged. Because this is Socratic tutoring, an insight counts as covered whether the discussion states it directly OR poses a guiding question that leads the novice to that specific leverage point — for example, asking what would happen if the desired safety margin were reduced covers the safety-margin insight. Mark covered=true only when the specific idea is genuinely engaged — asserted or targeted by a question — not when merely an adjacent topic is mentioned in passing.
2. Guiding questions — decide whether the discussion actually generates guiding questions that invite the novice to reason about the system or its policies (Socratic teaching). Genuine guiding questions probe the learner's understanding or prompt them to think about leverage points; generic pleasantries such as "Any other questions?" do not count.
