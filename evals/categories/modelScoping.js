/**
 * This is the model scoping test
 *
 * The model scoping evaluation category tests whether a model discussion engine can set the
 * boundary of a system dynamics model correctly for the problem it is asked to address: can it
 * say which mechanisms should be *included* in the model, and which should be *excluded* from
 * it? Choosing the model boundary in light of the problem definition is one of the hardest and
 * most consequential steps in system dynamics — a good modeler pulls in the mechanisms that
 * materially drive the behavior of interest and leaves out those that, for this particular
 * problem, act on a very different time scale, are effectively constant over the relevant
 * horizon, sit below the level of aggregation, or belong to an altogether different question.
 *
 * Each test presents the engine with a modeling case: a problem statement, some background
 * knowledge, and a numbered list of candidate mechanisms. Some of those candidates genuinely
 * belong in a model built for that problem ("in-boundary"); the rest are plausible-sounding
 * distractors that a competent modeler would deliberately leave out ("out-of-boundary"). The
 * engine is asked to make a clear include-or-exclude decision for every candidate. An LLM judge
 * then reads the engine's discussion and reports, for each candidate, only what the engine
 * actually decided (include / exclude / unclear). This category's code compares those decisions
 * to the ground truth, failing the test when an in-boundary mechanism was not included, when an
 * out-of-boundary mechanism was not excluded, or when the engine failed to commit to a decision.
