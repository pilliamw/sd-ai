    * so adding a rung — or renaming one, or giving a provider its own vocabulary — is
    * a config edit and a restart, with no code change and no client release.
    *
    * Ladders are PER PROVIDER and ordered low -> high. A provider absent from
    * `providers` ignores the lever entirely and keeps its nativeAgentProviders model:
    * that absence IS the "providers that support it" gate, which is why the OpenRouter
    * brands need no entry and no special case. Levels are matched by `id`, never by
    * position, so two providers may name their rungs differently; a client asking for
    * an id the selected provider does not offer gets that provider's default rather
    * than an error.
    *
    * Per level:
    *   id            required — the value the client sends back on select_agent /
    *                 set_intelligence.
    *   label         optional — UI text. Defaults to a title-cased id.
    *   description   optional — client tooltip.
    *   model         required — the conversation model.
    *   effort        OPTIONAL — omit to send NO effort/thinking parameter at all and
    *                 let the provider apply its own default. Omitting is not the same
    *                 as sending a low value, which is why it is expressible here.
    *   thinking      optional — provider-shaped override of agentAnthropicThinking.
    *   relativeCost  optional — overrides the multiplier derived from pricing.js.
    *   toolModels    optional — engine-tool lanes for this rung, same shape as an
    *                 agentToolModels lane; falls back to agentToolModels below.
    *
    * The floor is the default: the first level of each ladder reproduces today's

    * unreachable from here — it remains the server-internal summaryModel.
