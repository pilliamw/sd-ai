/**
 * Regression guard: every engine must name its credential parameters the same way.
 *
 * POST /:engine/generate waives AUTHENTICATION_KEY when the request carries its
 * own API key, on the reasoning that such a request runs on the caller's account
 * rather than the operator's. That reasoning holds only while "the client sent
 * openAIKey" implies "the client's key is the one that gets used".
 *
 * causal-chains broke the implication by naming its OpenAI parameter `apiKey`.
 * The route checked `openAIKey`, saw it, waived authentication — and the engine,
 * looking for `apiKey` and finding none, fell back to
 * `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY`. An unauthenticated caller got a free ride on the
 * operator's credits.
 *
 * The runtime check cannot detect this: `additionalParameters()` is the list the
 * client UI renders, and several engines advertise only the key for their
 * default model while LLMWrapper honours all three regardless. So the invariant
 * is enforced here instead — statically, across every engine, at CI time.
